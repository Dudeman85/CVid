Rasterizer:
- Rethink the screenspace coordinate system
- optimize out wireframe drawing over filled triangle
Window:
- Fix ipc sync
- Add resizing
- Fix pipe buffer issues
- buffer issue causes pipe disconnect when sending too much data
- fix stuff out of bounds (maybe issue with rasterizer)

Futures:
- runtime palette swapping if possible
